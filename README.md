This exercise accomplishes the following tasks:

Conduct Quantitative Analysis

a. Analyzed the data to see if any of the portfolios outperform the stock market (i.e., the S&P TSX 60).

Performance Analysis

a. Calculated and plotted daily returns of all portfolios.

b. Calculated and plotted cumulative returns for all portfolios.

Risk Analysis

a. Created a box plot for each of the returns.

b. Calculated the standard deviation for each portfolio.

c. Determined which portfolios are riskier than the S&P TSX 60

d. Calculated the Annualized Standard Deviation.

Rolling Statistics

a. Calculated and plotted the rolling standard deviation for all portfolios using a 21-day window.

b. Calculated and plotted the correlation between each stock to determine which portfolios may mimick the S&P TSX 60.

c. Chose one portfolio, then calculated and plotted the 60-day rolling beta for it and the S&P TSX 60.

d. Calculated and plotted the exponentially weighted average using a 21-day half life window.

Sharpe Ratios

a. Using the daily returns, calculated and visualized the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot.

b. Determined whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P TSX 60) and the whales portfolios.
